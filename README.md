# School_District_Analysis

## OVERVIEW

After looking over the test results for an entire school district and discovering that one school had submitted incorrect test results, we dive into an analysis that corrects those errors without compromising our data set and observing how these now accurate results imapact the resupts of our overall analysis. We know that the errors in our data set come from the ninth grade class of Thomas High School so we must remove them.

## RESULTS

After completin the analysis correctly it's seem that average grades in Thomas High change, average reading scores went from 83.84 to 83.89 and math from 83.41 to 83.35.
